10.10.2023:
    * probably a bug
    scanner weird behaviour such as it's returning one token TYPE_EOL after
    a block comment ends, i'm not sure if it might affect the project in the future

    * add to error detection
    recognize incorrect lexems with ? (only Int?, String? and Double? are acceptable,
    add fix later)
